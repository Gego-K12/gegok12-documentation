# How Admin Adds Fees -  Step-by-Step Procedure


This guide shows how an Admin creates **structural fees** (recurring/standard fees) and **other fees** (one-time / ad hoc) so they appear in student profiles and on the Accountant dashboard.

## Menu Navigation

**Menu path:** Admin → Fee Management → Fee Records

## Decide Fee Type

Before adding, decide whether the fee is:

- **Structural Fee** — standard, recurring fees (tuition, transport, lab).
- **Other Fee** — one-time or ad-hoc charges (exam fine, book fee).

## Add / Record Fee Type

1.	Click **Fee Records** (or Fee Types).
2.	Click **Add New** (or Add Fee Type).
3.	In the form, enter:

- **Fee Type / Name** (e.g., Tuition, Transport, Exam Fine)
- **Description** (optional — brief purpose)

4.	Click **Submit / Save.**
Result: New fee type is created and available when adding specific fee entries.

Create all required fee types first (tuition, transport, admission, etc.) so they appear in dropdowns later.

## Add a Specific Fee Record (Structure or Other Fee)

1.	From **Fee Records, click Add Fee** (or Add New Fee).
2.	Complete the **fee form** fields:

- **Fee Name / Title:** Clear title (e.g., “Tuition — Grade 2 — Term2”)
- **Fee Type:** Choose from the previously created types (Structural / Other)
- **Fee For:** Select target (Class / Student / Section / Category)
- **Select Class / Section / Student(s):** Pick the class this fee applies to
- **Term / Session:** (if applicable) Term 1 / Semester / Academic Year
- **Amount:** Enter the fee amount
- **Payment Date / Start Date:** Date from which payment window opens 
- **Due Date / Last Date:** Final date for payment

3.	Click **Submit / Save.**

## Verify in Student Profile

1.	Open a sample **Student Profile** (one of the targeted students).
2.	Go to the **Fee / Fee Records** section.
3.	Confirm the **new fee** (title, amount, due date) appears for that student.

•	The newly added fee will reflect on the **Accountant Dashboard** under:

- **Unpaid Fees / Pending Collections** (if not yet paid)
- **Fee Due Dates / Upcoming Payments** (based on payment/due date)
- **Fee Reports** → administrators / accountants can view totals by class, term, or status
