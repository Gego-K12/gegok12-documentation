# GegoK12 Reception Management Module

A Complete Guide for Admins & Receptionists

---

## Introduction

The **Reception Module** in GegoK12 is designed to modernize and digitize the school’s front-desk operations. As the first point of contact for parents, visitors, students, and vendors, receptionists handle a large volume of daily communications. This module provides them with the tools they need to manage every visitor entry, phone call, postal item, and task efficiently.

The Reception Module gives receptionists their own **login, dashboard**, and **workflow tools** to manage:

- Visitor Log
- Call Log
- Postal Record
- To-Do List
- Calendar View
- Holiday List
- Notice Board
- Activity Log

This ensures transparency, accountability, and a smooth front-desk experience for the entire school community.

## Calendar & Events

### Overview

The Calendar gives the receptionist a **holistic, real-time picture** of all events happening in the school. Since events impact visitor flow and parent enquiries, staying informed is crucial.

The calendar displays events created by:

- **Admin** → School-wide events
- **Teachers** → Class-level events

This ensures the receptionist always knows:

- What is happening today
- Which classes are engaged
- When important events are scheduled
- Whether a day is likely to be busy at the front desk

### Using the Calendar

The receptionist generally **does not create events**. But there is an option to create Events. For Events, check the [Link to Calendar Module] Calendar Module. They use the calendar to view and refer to school activities.

Steps:

1. Go to the **Calendar** from the left menu
2. Browse events using **Day**, **Week**, or **Month** view
3. Click on any event to see full details—title, time, creator, event type
